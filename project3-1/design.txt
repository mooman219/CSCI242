CSX Puzzle Solver, Project Part 2:  Water & Clock

Name: Joseph Cumbo


1. Explain how your common solver is able to work with both puzzles.
Puzzle uses a generic type for the datatype it is manipulating. Sovler
then uses generics to return and input the proper types.


2. What was the type of configuration you used for each puzzle?
The Clock puzzle used an integer.
The Water puzzle used a JugState object.


3. Starting with the Puzzle interface from part 1, what were the major
changes and additions you had to make?
Puzzle now uses generics for the type of object it manipulates.



4. What problems, if any, did you encounter when re-designing your 
project from part 1?
None. Puzzle just needed to include an element type and the puzzles needed
to give a element type. Example, Clock implemented Puzzle<Integer> and
Water implemented Puzzle<Water.JugState>.
