Name:

Question 1:
  What is the imbalance measurement value for the "simple" string
  hash function}?
  
Answer 1:
  The simple hash function gave me an imbalance of 11;

Question 2: 
  What is the imbalance value for your custom hash function?
 
Answer 2:
  My hash function gave me an imbalance of 0.

Question 3: 
How do different hashing functions affect the number of
times that the hash table must resize?

Answer 3:
  Since the rehash function was based on the total elements in the 
  table and not the total number of empty chains (As mentioned in 
  the second bullet of 5.2 Resizing a HashTable), there should be 
  no correlation between hashing function and number of times 
  resized.
  
  If the load function was determined by the number of empty chains
  remaining, then the hash function with less collisions would result
  in more resizes.
  
  If the load function was determined by the imbalance function, then
  the hash function with less collisions would result in fewer
  resizes.
